Here be the beadcrumps to maybe make easier sense of trying to manage the plot

Werewolf

Math teacher had question suggesting that polypinkiloid would do something about lucantropy

Chemistry teacher is missing a purple potion. polypinkiloid is kinda like pink.

History teacher wants Merry to return Tar book

Cleaning cellar book is named "Bernad Tar", last page has cribble "Maybe mix polypinkiliod with grey pain?" - that student (which might be unidentified absed on prot knowledge) is trying to produce a potion for specific effect

Rascal mentions that some department is extorting money for secret drinks


formula & cure & extort
Registry shows merry bieber to be a student of zoology -> werewolf is identified

Mess around murderbathroom is signs of struggle

I guess Merry is a messy also as a human as that indicates guilt for merry even without lucantropy.

In conclusion "that totally random student" turns to "Merry Bieber" and counts as getting the perperator right (if actually guilty)



Torn Protagonist
In wake up protagonist is missing pens. These are supposed to be the ones in murderbathroom. This is evidence he was there already.



box office uses neurotoxin
-> runa talks about animal policy, gives sleep powder, motive reveal for runa
-> option to sleep cats in post





teleportation

after some clocks ticks which ticks every time hallway is visited, corpse decays
-> decayed corpse torso can be searched for key
-> key can be used to open office drawers
-> drawer has communication receiver to control fancy lock


postworker explain "handle with care", knowledge about chemistry mailing bombs
-> ask chemistry teacher about it and they tell of a hidden machine in auditorium, this device is used for affair purposes
-> audittorium panel is findable


rascal can be asked about experiement
-> auditorium can be used to access producer
-> producer can produce "superpass word"


panel & "superpass" & anti-correlation source(!!!currenly missing!!!)
-> plug in pass and anti-cor to generate a season reading

-> season reading & communication receiver
Inserst anti-cor and reading to make fancy lock open
